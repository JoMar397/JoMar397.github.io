<p>Before I started attending the University of Maine, my life at home
was way different from what it is now. I used to take guitar lessons for
example, since I enjoy playing the guitar in my free time. I also played
the saxophone back in school starting in 5th grade, and played all the
way to my last year in high school. While taking part in this, I played
in my high school's jazz band, which was a fun experience for me. I also
had a job at my local ski area, since I liked to ski so much.</p>

<p>Enjoy this in the mean time</p>
