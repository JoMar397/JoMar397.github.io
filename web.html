<h4>About me</h4>

<p>Welcome to my homepage. I <i>enjoy</i> skiing and hiking when I have
free time, or I enjoy just hanging out. I like to watch baseball, and I
am a fan of the Boston Red Sox. I also love to watch movies, which is
something that I have gotten into recently. I am enrolled in the
University of Maine Business School, where I pursue to go into the world
of business afterwards. Feel free to explore my homepage, as well as the
other pages to learn more about me!</p>

<p>~JM</p>
