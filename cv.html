<p> In my free time, I like to ski, watch baseball, and hike. I
have been skiing for nearly all of my life. Some of my favorite
mountains that I like to ski at include Sunday River,
Whiteface, and Saddleback. For the past 3 years, I have been
working as a ski instructor at my local ski area, called Ski
Sundown. As of recently, I have gotten to enjoy watching
baseball, after receiving a summer job working as grounds
crew for the local baseball tournament. I like to watch the
Red Sox most of all. I also have recently got into hiking. I
climbed Mt. Katahdin about 4 years ago, but I haven't done
anything like that ever since.
