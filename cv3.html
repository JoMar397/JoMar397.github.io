<p>My family consists of my parents, as well as my two brothers. My
parents are Cathie and Jamie Martin. My dad is very much into skiing,
much like I am. My mother stays at home, but she can be pretty helpful
when there is an issue that needs to be resolved. My brother, Ben, is
the youngest in my family, and he likes to watch baseball. His favorite
team is the Boston Red Sox, which is the same as me. Finally, my brother
Sam is the middle child in the family, and enjoys playing football, as
well as watching football.</p>
